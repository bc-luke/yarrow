Yarrow: Internals
=================

The intention is to build the documentation generator from the following three main components:

- Parser/Collector
- Object Model
- Output Converter

Processing a PHP library should require roughly the following steps:

1. Start at root directory of library
2. Collect all *.php files within that directory
3. Analyze the token stream of each PHP file
   - build an object for each class
   - build an object for each method in each class
   - register all docblocks applying to each class and method
4. Feed the tree of analyzed objects to the output converter
5. Generate HTML template files to output directory

Questions
---------

Should the token analyzer be run as the collector processes a file, or should the files be
collected then the tokens analyzed separately?

PHP 5.3 compatibility
---------------------

- Add new token signatures
- Anonymous functions?
