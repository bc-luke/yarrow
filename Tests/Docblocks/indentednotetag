/**
 * Facade that coordinates HTML Purifier's subsystems in order to purify HTML.
 *
 * @note There are several points in which configuration can be specified
 *       for HTML Purifier.  The precedence of these (from lowest to
 *       highest) is as follows:
 *          -# Instance: new HTMLPurifier($config)
 *          -# Invocation: purify($html, $config)
 *       These configurations are entirely independent of each other and
 *       are *not* merged (this behavior may change in the future).
 *
 * @todo We need an easier way to inject strategies using the configuration
 *       object.
