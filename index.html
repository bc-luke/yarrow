	<h2>Philosophy</h2>

	<p>People writing libraries and utility classes do not have the same requirements for documentation as people working on large applications. In order to be useful, a documentation generator should provide output in a format and structure that suits the particular size and shape of a project.</p>

	<p>The core design principle of Yarrow is that that documentation output should not be locked to the class-per-file pattern or a narrow range of output formats. Yarrow is designed with such flexibility in mind. The tool can be customized to produce diverse documents – from a single page manual for a small and focused API, to a multi-page documentation system for a large application.</p>
