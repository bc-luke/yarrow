title: Yarrow - Simple Documentation Generator for PHP
---

<h1>Yarrow</h1>

<p>Finally, a tidy documentation tool for PHP projects.</p>

<p>Yarrow shreds your PHP code files and converts their structure into user friendly API documentation.</p>

<p>Yarrow is a fully object oriented library written in idiomatic PHP. You can easily extend it to produce your own custom documentation tools.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>The needs of people writing libraries and utility classes are not the same as those of people working on large applications. In order to be useful, a documentation generator must provide value in a wide variety of use cases where concise and readable documentation is required in a format that suits the particular size and shape of a PHP project.</p>

<p>Yarrow takes the approach that documentation output should not be locked to the class-per-file pattern. This provides the flexibility to produce diverse documents – from a single page manual for a small, tightly focused API, to a multi-page documentation system for a large application.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>

<p>The recommended method of installing Yarrow is through the official PEAR channel:

<pre>
$ pear channel-discover yo.yarrowdoc.org
$ pear install yarrow/Yarrow
</pre>

<p>Depending on how PEAR is set up on your local system, you may need to use sudo.</p>

<p>If you download the code manually, you need to place the Yarrow folder somewhere on your PHP include path and add the yarrow.php file to your bin path, changing its permissions so that it is executable.</p>

<p>More to come...</p>
