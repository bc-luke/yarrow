Yarrow
======

Finally, a tidy documentation tool for PHP projects.

More info: http://yarrowdoc.org/

Motivation
----------

The needs of people writing libraries and utility classes are not the same as those of people working on large applications. In order to be useful, a documentation generator must provide value in a wide variety of use cases where concise and readable documentation is required in a format that suits the particular size and shape of a PHP project.

Yarrow takes the approach that documentation output should not be locked to the class-per-file pattern. This provides the flexibility to produce diverse documents – from a single page manual for a small, tightly focused API, to a multi-page documentation system for a large application.

Install
-------

The recommended method of installing Yarrow is through the official PEAR channel:

$ pear channel-discover yo.yarrowdoc.org
$ pear install yarrow/Yarrow

(Depending on how PEAR is set up on your local system, you may need to use sudo)

Usage
-----

$ yarrow -v
